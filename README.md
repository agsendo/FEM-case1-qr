## My process
First, I added a separate file for styling, adding some colours and fonts.
Then, I worked on the size of the main image with QR code, as well as margins and padding.
Next, I improved the fonts and text position.
Finally, I set the positions of the main section and footer. The main challange was to center all of the elements, keeping it responsive to the screen size.
